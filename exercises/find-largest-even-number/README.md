## Instructions

Imagine a friend hands you the following:

- A stack of 20 index cards with numbers written on them, face down

They ask you to find the largest even number in the stack of index cards and hand them a sticky note with that number written on it.

Your job is to invent and describe a process that follows [the rules][the-rules].

## Describe Your Process

In English, write a clear, step-by-step description of the process you just invented.  What does "clear" and "step-by-step" mean? To help you write a good description, keep the following scenario in mind. Or, better yet, actually carry it out with a friend!

Imagine going to a friend who has never seen this problem before. You give them a pad of sticky notes, a pen, and your description of the process. Finally, you hand them a stack of numbered index cards and ask them to carry out the process described.

You should feel confident that your friend could carry out the process with little-to-no explanation. They shouldn't even have to "know" that their goal is to find the largest number.

At a minimum, the following should be clear to your friend as they follow your instructions:

- What to do before they begin flipping cards (if anything)
- What to write on the sticky notes and when
- When to flip a card
- Between each flip, what to do with the information they can see
- When to stop flipping
- What to do after they've finished flipping cards (if anything)
- When to return the sticky note containing the answer

## Compare Your Description To Pseudocode

We've described a process for solving this problem in pseudocode, here: [pseudocode.md](pseudocode.md).

Remember, pseudocode is an informal, high-level description of a computer program. It's meant to communicate the structure of a program to another programmer without getting bogged down in the syntax of a specific language.  It's more structured than plain English, but less structured than actual, executable code.

Your description and the pseudocode are descriptions of processes that produce the same result. The steps they describe might not be identical since there's more than one way to calculate the result.

Put the two side-by-side and convince yourself that they produce the same result.  What aspects of the pseudocode make sense to you?  What parts are confusing? Do they describe the same sequence of steps?  If not, where do they differ?
